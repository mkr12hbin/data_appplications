write a python code to find the square root of a sum of 2 given numbers

ChatGPT
Certainly! You can use the math module in Python to find the square root of the sum of two given numbers. Here's a simple Python code snippet for that:

python
Copy code
import math

def sqrt_of_sum(num1, num2):
    # Calculate the sum of the two numbers
    sum_of_numbers = num1 + num2
    
    # Calculate the square root of the sum
    square_root_of_sum = math.sqrt(sum_of_numbers)
    
    return square_root_of_sum

# Example usage:
number1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

result = sqrt_of_sum(number1, number2)
print(f"The square root of the sum of {number1} and {number2} is: {result}")
This code takes two numbers as input, calculates their sum, and then finds the square root of that sum using the math.sqrt function. Finally, it prints the result.



User
write a comment beside every line of code

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's the code with comments explaining each line:

python
Copy code
import math  # Import the math module to use the sqrt function

def sqrt_of_sum(num1, num2):
    # Calculate the sum of the two numbers
    sum_of_numbers = num1 + num2
    
    # Calculate the square root of the sum using the math.sqrt function
    square_root_of_sum = math.sqrt(sum_of_numbers)
    
    # Return the result of the square root calculation
    return square_root_of_sum

# Example usage:
number1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))  # Get the first number as input from the user
number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))  # Get the second number as input from the user

result = sqrt_of_sum(number1, number2)  # Call the function with the input numbers and store the result
print(f"The square root of the sum of {number1} and {number2} is: {result}")  # Print the result with a formatted string
I added comments to explain each line of code for better understanding.



User
show the sum of the tow numbers aswell

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's the modified code to also print the sum of the two numbers:

python
Copy code
import math  # Import the math module to use the sqrt function

def sqrt_of_sum(num1, num2):
    # Calculate the sum of the two numbers
    sum_of_numbers = num1 + num2
    
    # Calculate the square root of the sum using the math.sqrt function
    square_root_of_sum = math.sqrt(sum_of_numbers)
    
    # Return the sum and the result of the square root calculation
    return sum_of_numbers, square_root_of_sum

# Example usage:
number1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))  # Get the first number as input from the user
number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))  # Get the second number as input from the user

sum_result, sqrt_result = sqrt_of_sum(number1, number2)  # Call the function with the input numbers and store the results

# Print the sum and the square root result with formatted strings
print(f"The sum of {number1} and {number2} is: {sum_result}")
print(f"The square root of the sum is: {sqrt_result}")
Now, the function returns both the sum and the square root of the sum, and the program prints both the sum and the square root result.
